Question 1: Why do you think senior management finds it difficult to consider the impact on project management during pre-acquisition decision-making?

Senior management often finds it difficult to consider the impact on project management during pre-acquisition decision-making due to several reasons. Firstly, senior management may be more focused on the financial aspects of the acquisition, such as the potential for increased revenue and profits, rather than the operational aspects of the acquisition. This can lead to a lack of attention to the impact on project management, which can result in significant challenges during the post-acquisition integration phase.

Secondly, senior management may not have a clear understanding of the importance of project management in the success of an acquisition. They may view project management as a secondary concern, rather than a critical component of the acquisition process. This can lead to a lack of investment in project management resources and a lack of attention to project management best practices.

Thirdly, senior management may not have the necessary expertise in project management to fully understand the impact of an acquisition on project management. They may not have the knowledge or experience to identify potential challenges and develop strategies to mitigate them. This can result in a lack of attention to project management during the pre-acquisition decision-making process.

To address these challenges, senior management should prioritize project management during the pre-acquisition decision-making process. They should ensure that project management is given the necessary attention and resources to ensure a successful acquisition. This can include investing in project management expertise, developing a clear understanding of the impact of the acquisition on project management, and developing strategies to mitigate potential challenges.
