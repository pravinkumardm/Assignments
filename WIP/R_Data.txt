===================================== Planning the Project =====================================

Assigned Readings:
Chapter 11: Resource Planning
Chapter 12: Budget Planning
Overview:
Chapter 11 digs into resource planning.  This includes estimating the resources needed for a project and estimating activity durations using a number of different estimating tools and techniques.  Chapter 11 concludes with an in-depth review of resource management and the skills a project manager needs to manage resources effectively.  
Budget planning or cost management is the process of planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs to enable the project to be completed within budget.  Starting with a cost management plan that governs (or at least establishes the protocol for) the funding, distribution, management and control of the money, the challenges for the project manager and team lie in estimating the true costs of the project, finalizing a budget that covers the planned expenses and being able to measure, report and control costs throughout the project.  Chapter 12 introduces us to the planning process.
Learning Objectives:

    Know what goes into resource management. 
    Understand the skills needed and resource management techniques available for the examination of unbalanced use of resources.
    Understand the cost management plan
    Learn about the various tools and techniques for estimating cost.
    Know what it takes to create, manage and control a project budget.

    Schedule performance index (SPI)
    Cost performance index (CPI)
    Estimate to complete (ETC), assuming that the previous cost variances will not affect future costs
    Estimate at completion (EAC)
